# Welcome to Shoecommerce

This is an e-commerce single-page application (SPA) portfolio project for selling shoes. The project is divided into three main components: server, client, and an admin panel, representing a fully functional end-to-end application.    

The main user flow is as follows: a user selects products, adds them to the cart, logs in or signs up, makes a purchase, and the admin can then update the order status, which the user can view.    

There are many more implemented features, such as: 
  - Searching
  - Filtering
  - Sorting
  - Paggination
  - Dynamic loading
  - Item per page
  - Alerts
  - Statistics
  - Sliders and more
